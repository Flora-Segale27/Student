## 11/12/25 - The First Day!

*This was the day that I first used my GitHub ID and logged in to opencs to see my commit screen and dashboard.*

During this step, I learned how to use my newly-created GitHub account to log into GitHub and Open Coding Society and started looking up everything about commits and the other parts of GitHub.
