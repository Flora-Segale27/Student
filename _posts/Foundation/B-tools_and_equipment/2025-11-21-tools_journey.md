## 11/12/25 - The First Day!

*This was the day that I first used my GitHub ID and logged in to opencs to see my commit screen and dashboard.*

During this step, I learned how to use my newly-created GitHub account to log into GitHub and Open Coding Society and started looking up everything about commits and the other parts of GitHub.

My Open Coding Society account details:

My  GitHub account details:

My first commit: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about/initial_commit_action.png" >

## 11/13/25 - The Second Day!

*This was the day that I actually started working on the code in vscode, using vscode.dev through my browser and started writing on Issues.*

During *this* step, I started digging into index.md and about.md and changing my own code. I also published my GitHub server for the first time, although as I would find out, it was publishing the wrong site :sad:

Don't worry though! A day later, I figured out the problem and fixed it with the help of Anusha.

Wrong site:

## 11/14/25 - Day Three:

On day three, I got more into the nitty gritty of the code and started figuring out what all of the code meant - I read through all of the code in the GitHub actions to learn what it was doing, and I updated my Issues (and comments) every minute. My biggest discovery was finding out what was causing the disruption in the code to the site that was showing up. Anusha helped me realize that the yaml was trying to go to a repository that didn't exist. See, I had named my repository "**S**tudent", and the code that was written to connect the code to the url was preset to send the code to "**s**tudent" instead. Once we figured it out, Anusha changed it on the yaml and then the site finally worked as planned! I also re-ran the initial commit, which hadn't worked because of the preivous error.
