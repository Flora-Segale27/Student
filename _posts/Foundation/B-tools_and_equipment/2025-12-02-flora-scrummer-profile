Hello! My name is Flora Segale, and I am a Scrummer. A Scrummer is one of the four Agile archetypes, which also include the Planner, Technologist, and Closer. As a Scrummer, I thrive in collaborative environments where teamwork and communication are key to success. I enjoy facilitating discussions, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that everyone on the team is aligned with our goals.

## Characteristics of a Scrummer
Scrummers are known for their strong interpersonal skills and ability to foster a positive team dynamic. They are often seen as the glue that holds the team together, ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. Scrummers are also adept at managing time and resources, helping the team stay on track and meet deadlines.

## Needs of a Scrummer
To be effective in their role, Scrummers need a supportive team environment where open communication is encouraged. They thrive when they have the autonomy to make decisions and the trust of their teammates. Additionally, Scrummers benefit from clear goals and expectations, as well as access to resources that can help them facilitate team collaboration.

## Goals of a Scrummer
The primary goal of a Scrummer is to ensure that the team is functioning effectively and efficiently. This includes fostering a positive team culture, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the project goals. Scrummers also aim to improve team processes and workflows, helping the team to continuously improve and deliver high-quality results.
